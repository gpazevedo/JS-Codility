## Lesson 2: Arrays

[CyclicRotation](./CyclicRotation/README.md): Rotate array A K times.

[OddOccurrencesInArray](./OddOccurrencesInArray/README.md): Element with odd number of occurrances in an array.

## Lesson 3: Time Complexity

[FrogJmp](./FrogRiverOne/README.md): Minimal number of jumps to target

[PermMissingElem](./PermMissingElem/README.md): Find the missing element in a incomplete sequence.

[TapeEquilibrium](./TapeEquilibrium/README.md): Absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part of a sequence.

## Lesson 4: Counting Elements

[FrogRiverOne](./FrogRiverOne): Find the earliest time the frog can cross the river.

[MaxCounters](./MaxCounters): Maximizes n counters.

[MissingInteger](./MissingInteger): Missing positive integer.

[PermCheck](./PermCheck): Checks if an array has exactly the numbers of a permutation.

## Lesson 7: Stacks and Queues

[Brackets](./Brackets/README.md): Checks if a string is properly nested.

## Development Workflow

```
$ yarn test folder/app     # TDD with Unit Tests for the folder/app
$ yarn test:coverage       # TDD Unit Test coverage
$ yarn start folder/app    # Runs the program folder/app
```
