# MaxDoubleSliceSum

## Background

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

A triplet (X, Y, Z), such that 0 ≤ X < Y < Z < N, is called a double slice.

The sum of double slice (X, Y, Z) is the total of A[X + 1] + A[X + 2] + ... + A[Y − 1] + A[Y + 1] + A[Y + 2] + ... + A[Z − 1].

For example, array A such that:

```
    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 6
    A[3] = -1
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 5
    A[6] = -1
    A[7] = 2
```

contains the following example double slices:

double slice (0, 3, 6), sum is 2 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 17,
double slice (0, 3, 7), sum is 2 + 6 + 4 + 5 − 1 = 16,
double slice (3, 4, 5), sum is 0.
The goal is to find the maximal sum of any double slice.

## Goal

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximal sum of any double slice.

For example, given:

```
    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 6
    A[3] = -1
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 5
    A[6] = -1
    A[7] = 2
```

the function should return 17, because no double slice of array A has a sum of greater than 17.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [3..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−10,000..10,000].

## Clarifications

The array elements can form sequences. The value a sequence is the sum odf its elements.
The array's first and the last elements can't be part of any sequences.

The objective is to find a position that maximizes the sum of the values of the left sequence with the right sequence, both adjacent to this position.

## Design

The function calculates for each position the value of the sequence upto it (left sequence) and down to it (right sequence), but excluding it.

The maximum value is in the position that maximizes the sum of left with the right sequences.
